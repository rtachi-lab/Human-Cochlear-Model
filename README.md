# Human-Cochlear-Model
This repo provides a Python code for simulating the basilar membrane motion in the 1D and 2D transmission line models of the cochlea withou a middle ear model.

# Demonstration
To run the 1D model or the 2D model, execute CochlearModel_1D_Direct.py or CochlearModel_2D_Direct.py, respectively.
